- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NikKrytoi
- Hi I like to make my mod on Terraria, but I don't have much time to develop my mod because I am a high school student, but despite this I will continue and improve my mod.
- And also I am Russian and poorly understand English, so if in my mod that is not correctly written, you can write to me to change it.
